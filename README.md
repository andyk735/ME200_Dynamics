# ME200_Dynamicss

This course introduces the general principles of kinematics (the description of motion) and kinetics (the relationship between motion and the forces that cause it) that are necessary to understand, design, and analyze the motion of engineering systems. Topics include Newtonâ€™s laws of motion; two and three dimensional kinematics and kinetics of particles and rigid bodies; relative motion; work and energy relations; impulse and momentum relations; introduction to vibrations. Laboratory modules focus on numerical solutions of equations of motion.
